- Like about JS

  - can do both FP and OOP (Haskell + Java)
  - author of js wanted to have both from Java and Scheme programming languages

- Call stack

  - to store primitives (and function calls)
  - use `let` keyword to change memory adress

![](assets/20200508140935.png)

```js
let myString = "abc";
mystring = "abcd";
```

- Memory heap

  - to store non-primitives
  - use `const` keyword to keep the same memory address, but change value

```js
const myArray = [];
myArray.push(1);
```
